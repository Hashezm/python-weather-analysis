# python-weather-analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing weather data using Python. It includes data preprocessing, temperature conversion, precipitation handling, and specific analysis tasks to gain insights into weather patterns. The processed data is then saved in various formats for further use.

## Features

- Load weather data from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Convert temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius and add new columns for Celsius temperatures.
- Save the modified DataFrame to a pickle file for efficient storage and retrieval.
- Convert precipitation data from inches to centimeters and append it as a new column.
- Analyze weather data to find the maximum low temperature in July and the average daily rainfall in June.
- Save the processed data in multiple formats: CSV, Excel, Pickle, and JSON.
